# About
In that repository will be presented my skills related to SQL. To show them to you I've created a schema named ***'elite_parking'*** which is a kind of database of a hypothetical app for some wealthy area.
<br/>
The ***"Desription of the schema"*** file contains the schema of the database itself, all tables, filled with a test values, and an explanation of how all these things work.
<br/>
Each Task-file involves both the task condition and its solution in a very readable format.
<br/>
In the ***"Exported tables"*** folder it may be found all fetched from the database tables in json.
<br/>
The ***"Sourses"*** folder stores all used png-files.
